Binary Search Tree: for all nodes, left children <= current node <= right children

Balanced vs. Unbalanced: In a balanced tree, the depth of the left and right subtrees of every node differ by 1 or less.

Full Binary Tree: every node other than the leaves has two children.

Perfect Binary Tree: a full binary tree in which all leaves are at the same depth or same level, and in which every parent has two children.

Complete Binary Tree: a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible
